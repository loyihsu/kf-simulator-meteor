# KF-Simulator (a.k.a. C-HANer-free)

![Framework: Meteor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Framework&message=Meteor&color=red)

This is a KF simulator I (Loyi) wrote in May 2019.

It was written due to KS Mayor Han in Taiwan then kept repeating "FA-DA-CAI" (earn a great fortune) when asked anything in the City Council. One of my Facebook friend said that he wondered whether the mayor can pass the Turing Test.

So I wrote a chatbot which kept replying "FA-DA-CAI" to the incoming requests. And it sort of works...

> 2019 年中的時候因為某 HAN 姓市長在議會突然發大財，我學長就在說 HAN 這樣通不通得過圖靈測試，於是我就寫了一個最基本的 KF 模擬器，沒想到好像還原度偏高。
